            As you walk through the fields you are worried, if not a bit concerened that there are no animals; no cows, sheep not even birds any were to be seen.<br/>
            You carry on the grass gets taller, first it goes up to your ankles, then your knees, then your waist and then your head and over it.<br/>
            Jumping up to see any clearer patches ahead you see a mound of grass rising up from the ground, it's only a few meters ahead, mabye 20.<br/>
            As you walk up to the top of it you realise there is a small, round wooden door cut into the side of the hill you climb to the very top and look ahead.<br/>
            Everywere you look there is the tall grass and the flat ground with no life apart from you in it. You decide to have a little peek, mabye a little adventure<br/>
            Anyways it can't be worse that what you have already been thorugh. you pull the handle and peer inside, a set of spiraling staircases going down.<br/>
            There is just enough space for you to squeeze down.<br/>
            You go down plunging yourself into the cold, tight space that is a hole in the side of a hill.
